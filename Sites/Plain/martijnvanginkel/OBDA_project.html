          The assignment for this project came from Nedap, a software company that developed CarenZorgt. CarenZorgt is a platform for sharing information and scheduling appointments within healthcare. The assignment was to come up with a solution to help people with dementia forget less.

          The bigger challenge in this project was the target group. Itâ€™s hard to imagine being in that situation. In addition, it is difficult to get in touch with these people. It is a very protected group within the healthcare sector.

          After having talked and tested several times with the target group and people working in the healthcare sector, we found out that people can remember activities more easily than scheduled times. Pictures also make the activities more understandable.
          <br>
          But regardless of these insights we came closer to the target group. This has taught us how important it is for people with dementia that they maintain their self-esteem. Giving peace and self-confidence is therefore the most important thing. Someone with dementia can maintain a state of mild dementia longer if they feel calm. OBDA is therefore a supporter. It helps you remember daily activities, and is not an agenda you should stick to. Hence the name: Support for Daily Activities. (Ondersteuning Bij Dagelijkse Activiteiten)
          <br>
          The tasks are forwarded from CarenZorg to an e-ink display. This display can be used for 3 years without battery replacement or cable. This way the display can be anywhere in the house and the user and the carer do not have to worry about it.
